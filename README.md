## Learning Objectives  
  * students will be able to create asynchronous programs using the node.js callback pattern
  * students will be able to read, write, and encode binary data using the Buffer class
  * students will be able to utilize the built-in `fs` module for basic file system I/O operations
  * students will be able to use `done` (provided by mocha.js) for creating asynchronous tests
